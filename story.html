  <h2>Story continued...</h2>
    <p><strong>He came from a far away land, a land where there is no sky and there are 2 suns.</strong> There is a world beyond Terra (Earth) that is 
        full of life and is very peaceful. This world was his home. It is called <em>Aura</em> and it is a very beautiful place. On <em>Aura</em> 
        all beings live in harmony. Aurians live a life of pure bliss from the moment they are born 'til the day of passing. 
        The day of passing is called "TRANS-OVER". This is what is referred to as "death" on Terra. <br><br>
        On <em>Aura</em>, there is no limitation because everyone there treats all living creatures with respect and dignity. Every day is a day of 
        celebration and joy. No one wants for anything and beings create the most beautiful inventions. No one is ever bored there.
        Days are not measured the same on <em>Aura</em> as they are on Terra. This is a planet of pure vibration and music. 
        This was his home and this is a place where he was free. <br><br>
        On <em>Aura</em> life is full of excitement and every moment he lived free from fear as an unlimited being. Everyone is fully
        nourished by the suns and no one eats food as beings do on Earth. Aurians have two forms on <em>Aura</em>, 1. the avatar being and 2. the trans state 
        known as "glow". When an Aurian is in a glow state they are able to tap into the <em>Aura</em> energy of the planet in combination with the suns which allows them to move through
        time and space instantly and see all perspectives of life. He learned how to create worlds and how to transform light into physical 
        matter. Many of the precious metals on Terra are the biproducts of creations on <em>Aura</em> that have seeped through the realms.<br>
        Now that he's on Earth he's limited by gravity in all senses of the word. The gravity of life on Terra
        is the resistant force that keeps all beings bound to the Earth and blind to a higher level of understanding. On <em>Aura</em> one could fly and 
        travel faster than any vehicle known to man. In his glow form he was a being similar to a griffin, a dragon, or a phoenix. These are mythical
        creatures on Earth but are very real on <em>Aura</em>. In this form he was able to harness the energy of any sun and travel through any dimension
        and explore many worlds and realms. He was and still is very powerful, even on Terra. <br><br>
        As an Aurian he studied many mystical crafts that are unknown to man and lived as a supreme being fully understanding all the ways of worlds and the 
        source of life. The languages of Terra are not able to define or express many universal concepts nor their potentials.
        He knew all of these potentials and was tasked with creating a plethora of energies (many that are creative in nature) that many Terrans unfortunately misuse. 
        These creative energies when fully understood are able to completely transform the mind in a way that upgrades any being that becomes aware of 
        them and uses them properly. <br><br>
        One day on <em>Aura</em> is about 355 days on Terra. Aurians do not breath like beings on Terra do. They absorb all the essence of life in a much more efficient 
        way and so do not age physically. They are able to choose their day of Trans-over as well as the day of birth (for female Aurians). Aurians never incarnate in any of the worlds they create unless
        they choose to return in order to heal any damage that has been done in those worlds. Many Aurians have been documented in the history books of Terra (unaware of their true form) but 
        many more have not. He existed before Terra was created in the realm of the unknown. Now he is recalibrating the worlds to realign the energy of life 
        to that of the sound of the Universe and the spirit force. By the year <strong>7,777</strong> on Terra <strong>ALL</strong> beings will live on a level on par with that of the Aurians. He'll see
        to it, of that you can be sure.
        Who is he you ask?... He...is...Dexter!!!
